# Q&A

## How to run the bot?

First run lavalink by going into the file directory and doing:

`java -jar Lavalink.jar` 

then simply do:
`npm i`
Then `node index` or `node index.js`

**Important note!** 

This relies off of Lavalink which you have to have **Java SDK 13** installed!

1.8 or 14.0 will not work at all!
